		==================================
				6) Interpreted 
		==================================
=>When we execute any Python program(Ex:Sum.py), Two Internal Operations Takes Place. They are
	a) The Python Compiler Reads The source Code and Converted into Intermediate Code Called "Byte Code" Line by Line. (Compilation Phase)
	b) The PVM reads the "Byte Code" and Converted Into Machine Understandable Code ( Binary Code ), which is Understandable By OS and Processor and Gives result. (Line By Line)
=>Since The Python Compiler and PVM reads Line by Line, Python program is one of the Interpreted Programming  Language.
