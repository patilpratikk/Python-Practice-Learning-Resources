				a) filter()
		======================================
=>The purpose of filter() is that "To filter out some elements from list of elements by applying to the function"

=>Syntax:-       objectname=filter(function name, iterableobject)

Explanation:-   
=>"objectname" is of type <class,'filter'> and it contains filtered elements and an object of filter can be converted into any iterable object type
=>'functionname' is either Normal Function or anonymous Function name
=>"Iterable object" can be either str,bytes,bytearray,range,list,tuple,dict.
=>The execution behaviour of filter() is that " filter() applies every element of iterbale object to the function name, if the function name returns  True then that elements will filtered otherwise neglected (or not filtered) "
