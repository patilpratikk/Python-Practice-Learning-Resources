			Looping / Iterative / Repeatative Statements
		============================================
=>The purpose of looping statements is that " To Perform Certain Operations repeatedly until condtion False".

=>In Python, we have 2 types of Looping statements. They are

		a) while      (or)   while ...else
		b) for          (or)    for...else
		
=>While we are dealing with Looping statements, we must ensure that there must exist three points. They are
			a) Initlization Part
			b) Conditional Part
			c) Updation Part (Increment and decrement)

NOTE: Python Programming does not contain do..while.
