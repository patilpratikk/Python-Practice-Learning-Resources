		===============================================
				Types of Languages in Functions
		===============================================
=>In this context, we have two types of Programming Languages. They are
		1) Un-structured Programming languages
		2) Structured Programming languages
=>In Un-structured Programming languages, we don't have the concept of Functions.
=>Examples:   GW-BASIC
=>The Limitation of Un-Structured  Programming Languages are 
		1) Application development time is More
		2) Application Memory space is more
		3) Application Execution time is more
		4) Application Preformnace is Degraded
		5) Redundency of the code is more.
=>To Over these Problems we use Structured Programming Languages which provides FUNCTIONS.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>In Structured Programming languages, we have the concept of Functions.
=>The Advantages of Structured Programming languages are
		1) Application development time is Less
		2) Application Memory space is Les
		3) Application Execution time is Fast / Less
		4) Application Preformnace is Enhanced
		5) Redundency(duplication) of the code is Minimized.
